## Project Description

The Fake News Classifier project aims to classify news articles as either real or fake. The increasing spread of misinformation and fake news on the internet poses a significant challenge to societies worldwide. This project leverages machine learning algorithms to analyze and predict the authenticity of news articles based on various features extracted from the text.

The main objective of this project is to develop a reliable and efficient system that can help in identifying fake news and preventing the spread of misinformation. By using a combination of natural language processing (NLP) techniques and machine learning models, this project strives to provide accurate and timely detection of fake news.

## Methodologies

The project follows a structured approach to achieve its objectives. Here are the key methodologies and processes used:

1. **Data Collection**:
   - Collected a dataset of news articles labeled as real or fake from various sources.
   - The dataset includes features such as the title, text, author, and publication date of the articles.

2. **Data Preprocessing**:
   - Cleaned and preprocessed the text data to remove noise and irrelevant information.
   - Tokenized the text and converted it into a format suitable for machine learning models.
   - Applied techniques like stop-word removal, stemming, and lemmatization to standardize the text.

3. **Feature Extraction**:
   - Extracted relevant features from the text using techniques like TF-IDF (Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency) and word embeddings.
   - Engineered additional features based on the metadata of the articles, such as the length of the article, number of words, and publication source.

4. **Model Training**:
   - Trained various machine learning models, including logistic regression, decision trees, random forests, and support vector machines (SVM).
   - Used cross-validation to evaluate the performance of the models and select the best one.
   - Fine-tuned the hyperparameters of the selected model to optimize its performance.

5. **Model Evaluation**:
   - Evaluated the models using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.
   - Analyzed the results to understand the strengths and weaknesses of the models.
   - Selected the best-performing model for the final deployment.
